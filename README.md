Meteor ClojureScript Compiler
==


An (highly experimental) ClojureScript compiler based on [cljs-bootstrap](https://github.com/swannodette/cljs-bootstrap). No JVM is required.

# This is only the compiler part

This is only the compiler part of ClojureScript support. You normally would want to use settinghead:cljs-core package instead (which will automatically include this package as well).

# Project status: highly experimental

I only managed to get `cljs.core` working and haven't tested the ClojureScript integration extensively or in production mode. Pull requests on improvement are welcome.
